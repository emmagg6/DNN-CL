# propagation


This project is testing the continual learning abilities of new developments in biologically-plausible alternatives to back propagation in deep learning. This projects is at its beginning phases and is currently testing the continual learning abilities of fixed-weight difference target propagation (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2212.10352), difference target propagation (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1412.7525), and back propagation neural networks when trained sequentially on different multi-class classification tasks.
